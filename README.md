# PathFinder - A Java Program for Shortest Path Calculations

PathFinder is a Java program designed to compute the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. This application can handle various types of graphs, including directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted.

## Features

- **Multiple Graph Types**: Supports different types of graphs, including directed and undirected, with or without weights.
- **Graph Visualization**: Offers a simple graphical representation of the graphs and paths.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Utilizes several algorithms to find the shortest path, including Dijkstra's, A*, Bellman-Ford, and more.
- **Custom Graph Input**: Use custom graphs via text files - see the example graphs in the graphs folder.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays time and space complexity metrics for each algorithm's execution.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or above

### How to run the program

- Compile 'RunPathFinder.java'
- Run 'RunPathFinder.java'
